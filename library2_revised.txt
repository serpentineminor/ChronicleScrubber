Father Ormr
It flows through the cracks in your thoughts dripping down crevices in your mind like rainwater down a heap of gravel The burbling of voices backroom deals you remember it all

Father Ormr
Todds grin doesnt leave his face for even a moment

Genesis

Father Ormr
Oh nooothin Im just basking in the glory of a day well spent

Genesis
Im glad you had fun atleast I was a I was a bit worried you would just be stuck in there with Pas

Father Ormr
He shrugs The dudes not bad company himself All tough acting but he can be pretty chill

Genesis
You two did seem to to be getting along a bit better
he s a second and then asks
what were you two on about earlier aanyways

Father Ormr
Yeah I think Ive finally convinced him Im not gonna sling Simone over my shoulder like a Blist horror movie villain by now
He keeps his smile a bit subdued by now
Oh just chatting about the whole friendship you two have on You know dumb gossip Butlers gossip too yknow

Genesis
ah he never struck me as the um as the gossipy type

Father Ormr
Well guess you just cant muster the bronnection that me and him have edited
He follows his attempt at humor with a quirked eyebrow

Genesis
I wonder what Pas has told him
He um he seems to trust me atleast a fair amount

Father Ormr
I tried to weasel out if he had some hints about alien stuff but on that hes all clammed up Not a word nosirree
Oh well You know Im just built different

Genesis

Father Ormr
Oh by the way where are we headed Im just going straight towards the apartment haha
Oh I didnt tell him anything Just asked leading questions to see if I could trip him up you know

Genesis
home sounds home sounds good

Father Ormr
He could be completely ignorant who knows Not me
Sweet okay home it is

Genesis
The tests were ppretty exhausting Youd think after after a whole mug of Deathwish it would be enough to cancel it out he shrugs edited

Father Ormr
Some tests those must be
He pulls into the lot and parks the car fairly quickly headed to get inside

Genesis
glad to see him all hyped up he isnt too far behind using his flashlight for the stairs up

Father Ormr
Todd gladly climbs the stairs and throws himself onto the couch when he gets in
Phewww long night huh I might just turn in right now Im tuckered out

Genesis
Id be exhausted after after all that you did too he teases sitting on the couch next to him
what was that ttwo guys in one night

Father Ormr
Hey It was pretty clear that I wasnt getting anywhere with Cassius and honestly that rjan guy was just fun to bother
He holds up his hands Im not totally clueless If I made any real moves I think the scarecrow might would knife me

Genesis
probably Oskar was staring knives in the back of your head

Father Ormr
Despite their insistence that they arent an item yknow they sure are touchy about it ha
